# computing-php-project-2009-2010
My A-Level Computing project coursework with PHP source and MySQL sources.

Although the live site has long since been decommissioned, I still have the source code here.

The project was to design and develop a software project that used the principles taught in class, but also to use the skills learned during that year that I studied Computing to code the solution.

PHP and MySQL source code can be found here.
