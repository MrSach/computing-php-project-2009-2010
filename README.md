# computing-php-project-2009-2010
My A-Level Computing project coursework with PHP source and MySQL sources.

PHP and MySQL source code can be found here.

Although the live site has long since been decommissioned, in theory one may be able to replicate a LAMP server for testing the program.

The project was to design and develop a software project that used the principles taught in class, but also to use the skills learned during that year that I studied Computing to code the solution.

After speaking with the staff regarding project ideas, we agreed for me to build a program to target the school's mentoring system.

Alongside the source code there is also plenty of other documentation regrding the project.
