# computing-php-project-2009-2010
My A-Level Computing project coursework with PHP source and MySQL sources.

PHP and MySQL source code can be found
[here](https://github.com/MrSach/computing-php-project-2009-2010/tree/main/3-site/php).

Although the live site has long since been decommissioned, in theory one may be able to replicate a LAMP server for testing the program.

The project was to design and develop a software project that used the principles taught in class, but also to use the skills learned during that year that I studied Computing to code the solution.

After speaking with the staff regarding project ideas, we agreed for me to build a program to target the school's mentoring system.

Alongside the source code there is also plenty of other documentation regarding the project.

A few files that were not critical to this project were excluded for data protection reasons (a letter from staff and a written transcript for a meeting).
